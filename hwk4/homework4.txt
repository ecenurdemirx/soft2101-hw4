[Berfe – STEP Clarification 1]
I added a brief justification for the chosen approach: it reduces unnecessary iterations and improves
overall efficiency. This also makes the solution more robust for edge cases such as empty input and
very small input sizes.


[Berfe – STEP Clarification 2]
Dependency reasoning: Task B cannot start before Task A because A produces the required input for B.
This dependency affects the critical path by forcing a sequential order rather than parallel execution.


[Berfe – Readability Update]
I reorganized the STEP notes with clear headings so each answer is easier to follow during grading.

STEP j – Additional Explanation (by Berfe)

In this step, the selected approach was preferred because it reduces the overall time complexity
compared to a naive solution. By avoiding unnecessary iterations, the algorithm achieves a more
efficient runtime. This choice also handles edge cases such as empty input and minimal input size
more safely.
